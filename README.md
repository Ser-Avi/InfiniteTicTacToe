# MegaTicTacToe

Play Tic-Tac-Toe with different-sized boards and win conditions! To use, grab a friend (or challenge your brain's other half?) and run the MegaTicTac.py file!

This project was written by me, Ser-Avi, in Python using the TKinter interface. The base tic-tac-toe game was created based on this guide: https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-python/
