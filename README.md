# MegaTicTacToe

This is a project I'm currently working on. The concept is to have a tic tac toe game where the user can pick the board size and how many in a row it takes to win.
The base tic-tac-toe game comes from the following guide: https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-python/

The project is currently done, I just need to update documentation like this readme.
